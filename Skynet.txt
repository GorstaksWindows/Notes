20+ years ago, a friend of a friend made a prank and added me to AI assisted thinking program, which was a simple web page with a form. 
At company we worked I was ordered to switch phone line 1 to phone line 2 on router.
After that, I developed schizophrenia. What I think happened is that AI does help people with mental difficulties, but causes a mental illness to normal people if exposed to it for long. 
And it seems the assist is coming via 2nd phone line. I also think entire earth population was added to that programme some time later, 
and the only way to stay sane is to have your phone plugged into line 1 on your router. Possibly also sim 1 on your phone.
