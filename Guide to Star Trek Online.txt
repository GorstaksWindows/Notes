# Star Trek Online review

Pro's: 

1) Really free to play, if you have time to grind
2) A tonne of builds and mechanics to spice things up
3) Works nicely even on older machines
4) Chance to fly some of the most known ships in the galaxy
5) Chance to talk with celebs
6) Some nice people occasically help you with gifts.

Con's:

1) Innability to test game mechanics properly because your build isn't what is actually applied, instead they update a copy of you as they see fit, and that copy is actual stats.
2) Mods are extreme left, and they will silence you if you are rightist
3) Lots of bugs, getting stuck, missing items, etc.
4) Depending on level of your own IQ, after X ammount of time you realise the waste.

The above is as objectively written as I possibly can write. Personal observation and advice would be to yes, play this game, but don't spend real money on it, not a dime,
as stuff you will buy to perform better will do zilch, unless they update your copy. You will be unable to test game mechanics, or play properly.
And nothing you do will help you perform any better. It's all upto mods and stats on your copy. You can buy ships just to have bragging rights,
or play missions to follow the story with 1% of your brain. Any kind of competetion and trying to perform better is a fools errand. Basically they spend time forming an
opinion about you throwing bones in chat and decide what to do based on your reply or someones orders. This game isn't really a game where you can learn mechanics,
apply changes and thrive in your own smart thinking. This is basically a 3D social network garbage with star trek theme. If you do spend money on this, count on it as
pure cosmetics, even tho it should help you perform better. It wont if they decide it wont.

# Build
Cptn: Any, preferably Alien, preferably Rom.
Cptn career: Any, preferably sci.
Cptn skills: distance penalty should be maxed out, resists, cooldown reduction, crits and penetration is important.
Cptn spec: Temporal primary, strategist secondary.
Cptn traits: give your all and failsafe scrambler (for survivability), reconstructive radiation (against borg)
Space Traits: same as skills
Boffs: Preferably with trait Superior Romulan Operative (easy to obtain if cptn is rom, expensive for others), or watchers.
Boff Powers: Your ensign slot should always have Team ability, polarize hull and attack pattern beta is important, Intel powers and tractor beam are important if you have carrier wave shield hacking trait, Photonic officer is important to reduce cd.
Doffs: emergency conn hologram (from phoenix), energy officers with crtd (rare is good enough)
Ship: Any T6, preferably with 2 experimental upgrades.
Ship traits: any
Ship seating: any, for pvp you want cmdr intel
Ship Weapons: any, preferably with dmg/crtd mod, agony phasers should be decent, or crafted ones with pen mod.

protomatter consoles for heal and +dmg and xenotech consoles for hullpen and resall.
Ship gear: Omega force engines and shield, gamma rep core and colony deflector
Ship devices: Nimbus Pirates, Delta reinforcment, Phased Waveform, deuterium surplus, and romulan Rep consumables.

# Mechanics
Weapon base is mark I. That base is a small number. If you increase mark, dmg goes up. Weapon rarity basically means you have more mods on your weapons.
For example, normal beam at mark xv and 75 wep power does 5k dps. Attacking multiple targets means receiving more dmg and generating more threat.
Protomatter consoles will show as procs on your attack upgrades, so reducing cooldown on your attack upgrades is important. 
You can slot an attack upgrade even if you don't have those weapons slotted, to trigger the protomatter console. Give your all will show as procs on your eng skills. 
You also may want all bonuses applied prior to firing your weapons as they usually last longer than weapons fire. Haste will also help. 
Shields will deny 90-95% of your dmg, and lorca console is basicaclly shield pen. Hull resists (armor) can usually deny half of your dmg, so sources of pen, or attack pattern beta is important. 
Pen, be it shield or hull, doesn't beat resists, it actually increases bleedthrough. 
So normal shields have 5-10% bleedthroughs, and if you have lorca and shpen trait, you can get it to 100%. 
Similarily, hull resist 60% means there is 40% bleedthrough. Normal weapon procs are per cycle, meaning they have a chance every 4 or 5 shots, 
so look for stuff that is per hit, like agony phasers or attack pattern beta. In ideal conditions, your team will cast attack pattern beta on your target, 
they will be your nannies, so you can buff yourself up. Reverse Shield Polarity, aux to inertial, attack pattern omega, control immunity, polarize hull, 
dmg immunity are immunities which you can use, but against others using them you should use +75 pen to targets immune to dmg trait. 
Also, sitting ducks will recieve more dmg since they have lower defense stat, so you should always move, and try to slow down, or disable engines of your target. 
If you prefer not to move around, get Anchored trait. Ideally you wanna use 1 energy weapons aoe attack upgrade, 
with possibly one torp/mine aoe attack upgrade with 6s reload torps and/or fast reload mines. EPG is basically dmg that ignores shields and doesn't involve weapons.
Exotic is any dmg that ignores shields. Note I didn't write pen it, but ignore it. So if you don't have lorca console, I guess epg or exotic can be a cool build.
Torps I didn't play much around with, but usually dps is damage per second, meaning any wepon that does spike dmg is usefull, huge dmg in short ammount of time.
If you're chasing dps, look for that kind of weapons, and quad cannons maybe.

# Pvp
Pvp relies on not being targeted by using intel team and surgical strikes for dmg. If you have zahl trait, you wont be killed. 
Use subnuke first, then forceful inspection, any weapon boosts, then SS III.

# Math
A = acc is higher than defense stat
B = wep type * wep power * wep mark * dmg mod
C = bonus dmg and/or crit severity off of B dmg
A = B + C

# Example
You have +dmg consoles but don't debuff your target = low dmg
You have no +dmg consoles but debuff your target = low dmg
You have +dmg consoles and debuff your target = medium dmg
You have +dmg and high crits and debuff your target = high dmg
You have +dmg, high crits, haste and debuff your target = huge dmg
