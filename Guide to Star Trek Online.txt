This is a cookie cutter guide, up to date. I wont tell you how to play, will just list what I think you should get to be good.

# Build
Cptn: Any, preferably Alien, preferably Rom.
Cptn career: Any, preferably sci.
Cptn skills: distance penalty should be maxed out, resists, cooldown reduction, crits and penetration is important.
Cptn spec: Command primary, strategist secondary.
Cptn traits: Whole lotta X's, give your all and failsafe scrambler (for survivability), reconstructive radiation (against borg), intelligence agent attache
Space Traits: chrono, aux offense, evasive tactics and magnified firepower.
Boffs: Preferably with trait Superior Romulan Operative (easy to obtain if cptn is rom, expensive for others), or watchers.
Doffs: emergency conn hologram (from phoenix)
Ship: Any T6, preferably with 2 experimental upgrades.
Ship traits: punch it, directed dilithium burn, unconventional tactics.
Has hangars: Use elite type 7 shuttles and elite delta flyers, meaning you need to buy ahwahnee ship, then when you get unlock, buy elite version from fleet starbase.
Ship seating: any
Ship Weapons: any, preferably with dmg mod, agony phasers should be decent.
Consoles: lorca console, Image hull refractors, athan prime fleet museum beacon, protomatters, 2 isomags with resall, rest isomags with +dmg
Ship gear: Colony deflector, gamma rep core, reman engines and iconian rep shield.

# Mechanics
Weapon base is mark I. That base is a small number. If you increase mark, dmg goes up. Weapon rarity basically means you have more mods on your weapons.
For example, normal beam at mark xv and 75 wep power does 5k dps. Attacking multiple targets means receiving more dmg, so I recommend you use single target attack upgrades.
Protomatter consoles will show as procs on your attack upgrades, so reducing cooldown on your 2 attack upgrades is important. You also may want all bonuses applied prior
to firing your weapons as they usually last longer than weapons fire. Haste will also help. Shields will deny 90-95% of your dmg, so lorca console is important. 
Hull resists can usually deny half of your dmg, so sources of pen, or attack pattern beta is important. Normal weapon procs are per cycle, meaning they have a chance every
4 or 5 shots, so look for stuff that is per hit, like agony phasers or attack pattern beta.

# Math
A = acc is higher than defense stat
B = wep type * wep power * wep mark * dmg mod
C = bonus dmg and/or crit severity off of B dmg
A = B + C

# Example
You have +dmg consoles but don't debuff your target = low dmg
You have no +dmg consoles but debuff your target = low dmg
You have +dmg consoles and debuff your target = medium dmg
You have +dmg and high crits and debuff your target = high dmg
You have +dmg, high crits, haste and debuff your target = huge dmg

# Space keybinds
Copy the following in notepad and save as Space.txt. Then while you are in space in STO, type /unbind_all and then /bind_load_file D:\Space.txt (or path where you saved the file). 
Assign your powers to tray 7 and keep pressing spacebar during combat.

# Example of tray 7
emergency power to weapons, brace for impact, attack pattern beta, cannon rapid fire, beam overload, reverse shield polarity, emergency power to engines, evasive maneuvers, photonic officer

# Ground keybinds
Copy the following in notepad and save as Ground.txt. Then while you are on ground in STO, type /unbind_all and then /bind_load_file D:\Ground.txt (or path where you saved the file). 
Assign your abilities to tray 2 and 3, make sure basic weapon fire is in default location (tray 1 slot 1) and keep pressing key 1 during combat. 
space is for jump and both mouse buttons for sprint.
