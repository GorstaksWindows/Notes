This is a cookie cutter guide, up to date. I wont tell you how to play, will just list what I think you should get to be good.

# Build
Cptn: Any, preferably Alien, preferably Rom.
Cptn career: Any, preferably sci.
Cptn skills: distance penalty should be maxed out, resists, cooldown reduction, crits and penetration is important.
Cptn spec: Temporal primary, strategist secondary.
Cptn traits: Whole lotta X's, give your all and failsafe scrambler (for survivability), reconstructive radiation (against borg)
Space Traits: weapon procs + energy refrequencer
Boffs: Preferably with trait Superior Romulan Operative (easy to obtain if cptn is rom, expensive for others), or watchers.
Doffs: emergency conn hologram (from phoenix), energy officers with crtd
Ship: Any T6, preferably with 2 experimental upgrades.
Ship traits: punch it, directed dilithium burn, unconventional tactics, zahl
Has hangars: Use elite type 7 shuttles and elite delta flyers, meaning you need to buy ahwahnee ship, then when you get unlock, buy elite version from fleet starbase.
Ship seating: any
Ship Weapons: any, preferably with dmg/crtd mod, agony phasers should be decent, or crafted ones with pen mod.
Consoles: lorca console for shpen, isomags with your weapon type, dyson sci consoles, hostile aquisition for acc, slow down, and -drr, 
fleet power network array for additional attack upgrade and haste (you are also an ally), protomatter consoles for heal and +dmg and either amplifiers or dyson sci consoles.
Ship gear: Omega force deflector and shield, gamma rep core and engines (reeng engines for more spd).
Ship devices: Nimbus Pirates, Delta reinforcment, Phased Waveform, deuterium surplus, and romulan Rep consumables.

# Mechanics
Weapon base is mark I. That base is a small number. If you increase mark, dmg goes up. Weapon rarity basically means you have more mods on your weapons.
For example, normal beam at mark xv and 75 wep power does 5k dps. Attacking multiple targets means receiving more dmg and generating more threat.
Protomatter consoles will show as procs on your attack upgrades, so reducing cooldown on your attack upgrades is important. Give your all will show as procs on your 
eng skills. You also may want all bonuses applied prior to firing your weapons as they usually last longer than weapons fire. Haste will also help. 
Shields will deny 90-95% of your dmg, so lorca console is important. Hull resists can usually deny half of your dmg, so sources of pen, or attack pattern beta is important. 
Normal weapon procs are per cycle, meaning they have a chance every 4 or 5 shots, so look for stuff that is per hit, like agony phasers or attack pattern beta. 
Amplifiers from embassy will increase your threat, while dyson sci consoles will work with your omega force 2pc, tetryon glider. 
You put all +dmg, +crit stuff, but do low dmg. That is because opponents shields resisted 90% of your dmg to it's shields, 
and 5-10% bleedthrough means only 5-10% dmg went to hull, which met with 50-60% hull resists. This is why you need to have both hull pen and shield pen. 
In ideal conditions, your team will cast attack pattern beta on your target, they will be your nannies, so you can buff yourself up. If you are doing randoms, 
you're better off stacking any sources of crits. There is stuff like carrier wave shield hacking trait, which will drop their shield facing, 
and you should hit them hard when they do. Like, with torps. If not, you're better of beating their shield resists with lorca, and APB.
Reverse Shield Polarity, aux to inertial, attack pattern omega, control immunity, polarize hull, dmg immunity are all immunities which you can use, 
but against others using them you should use +75 pen to targets immune to dmg trait. Also, sitting ducks will recieve more dmg since they have lower defense stat, 
so you should always move, and try to slow down, or disable engines of your target. Try to avoid using more than 2 identical consoles.

# Pve
Ideally you wanna use 1 energy weapons aoe attack upgrade, with possibly one torp/mine aoe attack upgrade with 6s reload torps and/or fast reload mines. 
Attack pattern beta and any weapon procs will help. Basically, when you buff your self up for dmg, only 10% will go to their hull, which will meet resists.
So, you should buff yourself to kill both their shields and their hull while debuffing them. For example, you put 4 isomags or more and hit them hard with 100k
dmg. You will do 10k to their hull if you beat their hull resists and 90k to their shields if you beat their shield resists. 
Meaning any damage over time or other proc will help. Tho normal procs on weps are per cycle, meaning once every 4-5 shots, so weps like agony, which are per hit, 
are extremely valuable. Plasma will also kill target quickly since it ignores shields, while crafted weps with pen will help beat their hull resists.

# Pvp
Pvp relies on not being targeted by using intel team and surgical strikes for dmg. If you have zahl trait, you wont be killed. 
Use subnuke first, then carrier wave shield hacking, then forceful inspection, then SS III. Don't stay in battle after SS III expires.

# Math
A = acc is higher than defense stat
B = wep type * wep power * wep mark * dmg mod
C = bonus dmg and/or crit severity off of B dmg
A = B + C

# Example
You have +dmg consoles but don't debuff your target = low dmg
You have no +dmg consoles but debuff your target = low dmg
You have +dmg consoles and debuff your target = medium dmg
You have +dmg and high crits and debuff your target = high dmg
You have +dmg, high crits, haste and debuff your target = huge dmg

# Space keybinds
Copy the following in notepad and save as Space.txt. Then while you are in space in STO, type /unbind_all and then /bind_load_file D:\Space.txt (or path where you saved the file). 
Assign your lowest cd powers to tray 10 and 9 and keep pressing spacebar during combat.

# Ground keybinds
Copy the following in notepad and save as Ground.txt. Then while you are on ground in STO, type /unbind_all and then /bind_load_file D:\Ground.txt (or path where you saved the file). 
Assign your abilities to tray 2 and 3, make sure basic weapon fire is in default location (tray 1 slot 1) and keep pressing key 1 during combat. 
space is for jump and both mouse buttons for sprint.
