# Star Trek Online review

Pro's: 

1) Really free to play, if you have time to grind
2) A tonne of builds and mechanics to spice things up
3) Works nicely even on older machines
4) Chance to fly some of the most known ships in the galaxy
5) Chance to talk with celebs
6) Some nice people occasically help you with gifts.

Con's:

1) Innability to test game mechanics properly because your build isn't what is actually applied, instead they update a copy of you as they see fit, and that copy is actual stats.
2) Mods are extreme left, and they will silence you if you are rightist
3) They change your character appearance as they see fit. Sometimes you are tall, sometimes a midget, sometimes having someone elses face.
4) Lots of bugs, getting stuck, missing items, etc.
5) Depending on level of your own IQ, after X ammount of time you realise the waste.

The above is as objectively written as I possibly can write. Personal observation and advice would be to yes, play this game, but don't spend real money on it, not a dime,
as stuff you will buy to perform better will do zilch, unless they update your copy. You will be unable to test game mechanics, or play properly.
And nothing you do will help you perform any better. It's all upto mods and stats on your copy. You can buy ships just to have bragging rights,
or play missions to follow the story with 1% of your brain. Any kind of competetion and trying to perform better is a fools errand.
