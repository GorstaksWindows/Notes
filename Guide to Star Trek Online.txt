# Star Trek Online review

Pro's: 

1) Really free to play, if you have time to grind
2) A tonne of builds and mechanics to spice things up
3) Works nicely even on older machines
4) Chance to fly some of the most known ships in the galaxy
5) Chance to talk with celebs
6) Some nice people occasically help you with gifts.

Con's:

1) Innability to test game mechanics properly because your build isn't what is actually applied, instead they update a copy of you as they see fit, and that copy is actual stats.
2) Mods are extreme left, and they will silence you if you are rightist
3) Lots of bugs, getting stuck, missing items, etc.
4) Depending on level of your own IQ, after X ammount of time you realise the waste.

The above is as objectively written as I possibly can write. Personal observation and advice would be to yes, play this game, but don't spend real money on it, not a dime,
as stuff you will buy to perform better will do zilch, unless they update your copy. You will be unable to test game mechanics, or play properly.
And nothing you do will help you perform any better. It's all upto mods and stats on your copy. You can buy ships just to have bragging rights,
or play missions to follow the story with 1% of your brain. Any kind of competetion and trying to perform better is a fools errand. Basically they spend time forming an
opinion about you throwing bones in chat and decide what to do based on your reply or someones orders. This game isn't really a game where you can learn mechanics,
apply changes and thrive in your own smart thinking. This is basically a 3D social network garbage with star trek theme. If you do spend money on this, count on it as
pure cosmetics, even tho it should help you perform better. It wont if they decide it wont.

# Dmg calc
Weapon base is mark I. That base is a small number. If you increase mark, dmg goes up. Weapon rarity basically means you have more mods on your weapons.
For example, normal beam at mark XII does 500 dmg and at xv and 75 wep power does 1k dps. If you add 5 30% +dmg consoles and 5 dmg mods (10% +dmg each), 
that wep will do 200% more dmg, meaning 3k. If you also do surgical strikes III attack upgrade, for another 300%, it will do 6k. If you also do crit for 100%
it will be 800% +dmg on your 1k, meaning 9k dmg. If you also do haste 100%, it will be 18k. If you get 6 weps to do all that, it will be 108k. 
So, any single source of dmg is usually insufficient. At least get pets.

# Pvp
Pvp relies on not being targeted by using intel team and surgical strikes for dmg. If you have zahl trait, you wont be killed. 
Use subnuke first, then forceful inspection, any weapon boosts, then SS III.

# Example
You have +dmg consoles but don't debuff your target = low dmg
You have no +dmg consoles but debuff your target = low dmg
You have +dmg consoles and debuff your target = medium dmg
You have +dmg and high crits and debuff your target = high dmg
You have +dmg, high crits, haste and debuff your target = huge dmg

# Important
Some stuff is for veterans, and lowest vet tier unlocks at 100 days. Type "/played" into chat window.

# How to play
Tanking: Tanking relies on pulling aggro to increase threat by shooting multiple targets, then using strategist skill, colony deflector to increase your hullcap, your crits, your dmg res and incoming heals
Support: Support relies on debuffing your enemies and healing others. Pen and attack pattern beta is important, maybe type 7 shuttles too
Damage: Dps relies on slotting as much as possible +dmg (cat1) +bonus dmg (crtd), final multipliers (attack upgrades), reducing cd or extending uptime of attack upgrades, haste and piloting

# Space keybinds
Copy the following in notepad and save as Space.txt. Then while you are in space in STO, type /unbind_all and then /bind_load_file D:\Space.txt (or path where you saved the file). 
Assign your powers to tray 10, 9, 8 and 7 and keep pressing spacebar during combat. Press key 1 to fire weapons. If you slot mines, pressing 1 a few times will start the mines, 
and set your weapons on cycle, so you don't have to press 1 later on, just spacebar.
