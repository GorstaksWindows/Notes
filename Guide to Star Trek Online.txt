This is a cookie cutter guide, up to date. I wont tell you how to play, will just list what I think you should get to be good.

# Build
Cptn: Any, preferably Alien, preferably Rom.
Cptn career: Any, preferably sci.
Cptn skills: You want to get tac ultimate frenzy, at least for yourself, distance penalty should be minimum, resists are important.
Cptn spec: Command primary, strategist secondary.
Cptn traits: Whole lotta X's and failsafe scrambler (for survivability), reconstrive radiation (against borg), intelligence agent attache
Boffs: Preferably with trait Superior Romulan Operative (easy to obtain if cptn is rom, expensive for others).
Boff powers: You want to buy kemocite I off of exchange, attack pattern beta is also important.
Ship: Any T6, preferably with 2 experimental upgrades.
Ship traits: Carrier wave shield hacking (if intel ship) and punch it.
Has hangars: Use elite type 7 shuttles, meaning you need to buy ahwahnee ship, then when you get unlock, buy elite versions from fleet starbase.
Ship seating: If Intel, use surgical strikes, if anything else, use cannon scatter volley and fire at will.
Ship Weapons: Beams in front and turrets rest.
Consoles: Hull image refractors is a must, hostile aquisition is optional. Xenotech drift consoles with hullpen if you don't have hangar, lorca console is a must, rest protomatter consoles.
Ship gear: Colony deflector, gamma rep core, competetive rep engines and iconian rep shield.
