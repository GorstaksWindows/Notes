# Star Trek Online review

Pro's: 

1) Really free to play, if you have time to grind
2) A tonne of builds and mechanics to spice things up
3) Works nicely even on older machines
4) Chance to fly some of the most known ships in the galaxy
5) Chance to talk with celebs
6) Some nice people occasically help you with gifts.

Con's:

1) Innability to test game mechanics properly because your build isn't what is actually applied, instead they update a copy of you as they see fit, and that copy is actual stats.
2) Mods are extreme left, and they will silence you if you are rightist
3) Lots of bugs, getting stuck, missing items, etc.
4) Depending on level of your own IQ, after X ammount of time you realise the waste.

The above is as objectively written as I possibly can write. Personal observation and advice would be to yes, play this game, but don't spend real money on it, not a dime,
as stuff you will buy to perform better will do zilch, unless they update your copy. You will be unable to test game mechanics, or play properly.
And nothing you do will help you perform any better. It's all upto mods and stats on your copy. You can buy ships just to have bragging rights,
or play missions to follow the story with 1% of your brain. Any kind of competetion and trying to perform better is a fools errand. Basically they spend time forming an
opinion about you throwing bones in chat and decide what to do based on your reply or someones orders. This game isn't really a game where you can learn mechanics,
apply changes and thrive in your own smart thinking. This is basically a 3D social network garbage with star trek theme. If you do spend money on this, count on it as
pure cosmetics, even tho it should help you perform better. It wont if they decide it wont.

# Mechanics
Weapon base is mark I. That base is a small number. If you increase mark, dmg goes up. Weapon rarity basically means you have more mods on your weapons.
For example, normal beam at mark xv and 75 wep power does 5k dps. Attacking multiple targets means receiving more dmg and generating more threat.
Protomatter consoles will show as procs on your attack upgrades, so reducing cooldown on your attack upgrades is important. You may slot an attack upgrade even if you don't 
have those weapons slotted, to trigger the protomatter console. Give your all will show as procs on your eng skills. You also may want all bonuses applied prior to firing 
your weapons as they usually last longer than weapons fire. Haste will also help. Shields will deny 90-95% of your dmg, and lorca console will beat their shield resists
so you do full dmg to their shields. Hull resists (armor) can usually deny half of your dmg, so sources of pen, or attack pattern beta is important. 
Normal weapon procs are per cycle, meaning they have a chance every 4 or 5 shots, so look for stuff that is per hit, like agony phasers or attack pattern beta. 
Amplifiers from embassy will increase your threat, while dyson sci consoles will work with your omega force 2pc, tetryon glider. 
Shields have a 5-10% bleedthrough means only 5-10% dmg went to hull, which met with 50-60% hull resists. This is why you need to have both hull pen and shield pen. 
In ideal conditions, your team will cast attack pattern beta on your target, they will be your nannies, so you can buff yourself up. 
There is stuff like carrier wave shield hacking trait, which will drop their shield facing, and you should hit them hard when they do. Like, with torps. 
If not, you're better of beating their shield resists with lorca, and using APB. 
Reverse Shield Polarity, aux to inertial, attack pattern omega, control immunity, polarize hull, dmg immunity are all immunities which you can use, 
but against others using them you should use +75 pen to targets immune to dmg trait. Also, sitting ducks will recieve more dmg since they have lower defense stat, 
so you should always move, and try to slow down, or disable engines of your target.

# Pve
Ideally you wanna use 1 energy weapons aoe attack upgrade, with possibly one torp/mine aoe attack upgrade with 6s reload torps and/or fast reload mines. 
Attack pattern beta and any weapon procs will help. Basically, when you buff your self up for dmg, only 5-10% will go to their hull, which will meet resists.
So, you should buff yourself to kill both their shields and their hull while debuffing them. For example, you put 4 isomags or more and hit them hard with 100k
dmg. You will do 10k to their hull if you beat their hull resists and 90k to their shields if you beat their shield resists. 
Meaning any damage over time or other proc will help. Tho normal procs on weps are per cycle, meaning once every 4-5 shots, so weps like agony, which are per hit, 
are extremely valuable. Plasma will also kill target quickly since it's proc ignores shields, while crafted weps with pen will help beat their hull resists.

# Pvp
Pvp relies on not being targeted by using intel team and surgical strikes for dmg. If you have zahl trait, you wont be killed. 
Use subnuke first, then carrier wave shield hacking, then forceful inspection, then SS III. Don't stay in battle after SS III expires.

# Math
A = acc is higher than defense stat
B = wep type * wep power * wep mark * dmg mod
C = bonus dmg and/or crit severity off of B dmg
A = B + C

# Example
You have +dmg consoles but don't debuff your target = low dmg
You have no +dmg consoles but debuff your target = low dmg
You have +dmg consoles and debuff your target = medium dmg
You have +dmg and high crits and debuff your target = high dmg
You have +dmg, high crits, haste and debuff your target = huge dmg
