This is a cookie cutter guide, up to date. I wont tell you how to play, will just list what I think you should get to be good.

# Build
Cptn: Any, preferably Alien, preferably Rom.
Cptn career: Any, preferably sci.
Cptn skills: You want to get tac ultimate frenzy, at least for yourself, distance penalty should be minimum, resists are important.
Cptn spec: Command primary, strategist secondary.
Cptn traits: Whole lotta X's, give your all and failsafe scrambler (for survivability), reconstructive radiation (against borg), intelligence agent attache
Space Traits: Active hull hardening is a must, chrono if you don't have photonic officer boff power, precision and tylers duality if you need crit chance, omega graviton for dps, energy refrequencer for heals.
Boffs: Preferably with trait Superior Romulan Operative (easy to obtain if cptn is rom, expensive for others), or watchers.
Boff powers: You want to buy kemocite off of exchange, attack pattern beta is also important.
Ship: Any T6, preferably with 2 experimental upgrades.
Ship traits: Carrier wave shield hacking (if intel ship), punch it, dilithium burn.
Has hangars: Use elite type 7 shuttles and elite delta flyers, meaning you need to buy ahwahnee ship, then when you get unlock, buy elite version from fleet starbase.
Ship seating: If Intel, use surgical strikes, if anything else, use cannon scatter volley and fire at will and torp spread.
Ship Weapons: any, preferably with dmg proc, ba'ul should be decent, agony too.
Consoles: Xenotech drift consoles with hullpen (eng), lorca console and protomatter (tac), Image hull refractors if you use colony console, otherwise weapon signature nullifiers with plasma proc (sci)
Ship gear: Colony deflector if you lack crit chance, otherwise fleet axion, gamma rep core, reman engines and iconian rep shield.

# Mechanics
Weapon base is mark I. That base is a small number. If you increase mark, dmg goes up. Weapon rarity basically means you have more mods on your weapons.
For example if you stack dmg mod, like 4x, dmg will go up 40%. If you stack crtd x4, dmg will go up 80% if you crit. If you don't have high crit chance, you're better off with dmg mod.
For example, normal beam at mark xv and 75 wep power does 5k dps. Surgical strikes III will increase your dmg 300%, plus your crit chance and severity,
meaning that beam will do 30k dps with surgical strikes III, but players that rely on 3 normal attack upgrades + console from ahwahnee can do 6x 32k dmg if they have other sources of +dmg. 
Also, if target has 90% resists, you will only do 10% of your dmg. Advanced consoles you can only have one type of, and I suggest you stack the ones your ship has most of.
Also, since there is only so much +dmg stuff you can stack, try to double or triple rate of fire with haste sources. Attacking multiple targets means receiving more dmg, 
so use single target attack upgrades, if you're squishy.

# Example
You have +dmg consoles but don't debuff your target = low dmg
You have no +dmg consoles but debuff your target = low dmg
You have +dmg consoles and debuff your target = medium dmg
You have +dmg and high crits and debuff your target = high dmg
You have +dmg, high crits, haste and debuff your target = huge dmg
You have +dmg, high crits, haste, debuff your target and your weps have a whole list of procs = l33t

# Space keybinds
Copy the following in notepad and save as Space.txt. Then while you are in space in STO, type /unbind_all and then /bind_load_file D:\Space.txt (or path where you saved the file). 
Assign your powers to tray 10, 9, 8 and 7 and keep pressing spacebar during combat.

# Ground keybinds
Copy the following in notepad and save as Ground.txt. Then while you are on ground in STO, type /unbind_all and then /bind_load_file D:\Ground.txt (or path where you saved the file). 
Assign your abilities to tray 2 and 3, make sure basic weapon fire is in default location (tray 1 slot 1) and keep pressing key 1 during combat. 
space is for jump and both mouse buttons for sprint.
